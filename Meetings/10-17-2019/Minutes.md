# ARs

- [x] Blaine: email Eric and Andrew about which LCD type would be accepable for the project 
> Completed: 10\17\2019
>> [Andrew's Response. email 10/17/2019] I'm not sure what you mean by "acceptable". Both LCDs are perfectly acceptable as "actuators" in the practicum project.
**The first LCD is simple to use character-based LCD, straight forward to use, and would make an excellent choice for a simple practicum project.**
The second LCD is a widely used graphical LCD that requires a C graphics library and, in my opinion, a 32 bit microcontroller with plenty of flash and RAM. If you'd like to go down that route, that's perfectly acceptable, *although of course I wouldn't suggest you do that.*
Hope that helps.
